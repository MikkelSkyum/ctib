All those elements `x` in the list where `x % 2 == 0` cannot be primes, so we can get rid of those. If we remove those and 2 we have a new list with 3 at the front. This is also a prime. And all those elements `x` in the new list where `x % 3 == 0` cannot be. We get rid of those and 3. The next element is 5 (because we got rid of 4 earlier when we removed all the values with `x % 2 == 0`). That is also a prime.\n",
