# Week 2:  Algorithm analysis

## Objects

* To learn how to *reason about computations* to construct *correct algorithms*.
* To learn how to *reason about complexity* so you can judge the efficiency of different solutions.

## Lectures notes

When we develop algorithms we naturally want them to be both correct and efficient. Constructing them such that they are, or convincing ourselves that a given algorithm is, requires some reasoning tricks.

### Pre- and post-conditions and invariants



### Big-O notation and reasoning about complexity

 
## Exercises
* Functions (JVG 4)
* Basic data structures (JVG 5)
