# Week 1: Introduction to computational thinking

## Objectives

* **To understand how we go from problem domains to models, specify problems and goals, derive algorithmic solutions, and finally implement our solutions.**
* **To get familiarity with programming in the Python programming language and using Jupyter notebooks.**

## Lecture notes

* What do we mean by computation and computational thinking in this class?
* What is the distinction between problem domains, models, goals and problems, solutions, algorithms, and implementations?
* Basic computational operations: branching, repeating, and recursing.

## Exercises

* Introduction to Python programming and Jupyter notebooks. 
* Branching and looping (JVG 2 + 3)
